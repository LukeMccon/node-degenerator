degenerator
===========
### Turns sync functions into async generator functions
[![Build
Status](https://travis-ci.org/TooTallNate/node-degenerator.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/TooTallNate/node-degenerator)

Sometimes you need to write sync looking code that's really async under the hood.
This module takes a String to one or more synchronous JavaScript functions, and
returns a new String that with those JS functions transpiled into an ES6 Generator
Functions.

So this:

``` js
function foo () {
  return a('bar') || b();
}
```

Gets compiled into:

``` js
function* foo() {
    return (yield a('bar')) || (yield b());
}
```

From there, you can provide asynchronous thunk-based or Generator-based
implementations for the `a()` and `b()` functions, in conjunction with any
Generator-based flow control library to execute the contents of the
function asynchronously.


Installation
------------

Install with `npm`:

``` bash
$ npm install degenerator
```


Example
-------

You must explicitly specify the names of the functions that should be
"asyncified". So say we wanted to expose a `get(url)` function that did
and HTTP request and returned the response body.

The user has provided us with this implementation:

``` js
function () {
  var one = get('https://google.com');
  var two = get('http://nodejs.org');
  var three = JSON.parse(get('http://jsonip.org'));
  return [one, two, three];
}
```

Now we can compile this into an asyncronous generator function, implement the
async `get()` function, and finally evaluate it into a real JavaScript function
instance with the `vm` module:


``` js
var vm = require('vm');
var degenerate = require('degenerate');

// the `get()` function is thunk-based (error handling omitted for brevity)
function get (endpoint) {
  return function (fn) {
    var mod = 0 == endpoint.indexOf('https:') ? require('https') : require('http');
    var req = mod.get(endpoint);
    req.on('response', function (res) {
      var data = '';
      res.setEncoding('utf8');
      res.on('data', function (b) { data += b; });
      res.on('end', function () {
        fn(null, data);
      });
    });
  };
}

// convert the JavaScript string provided from the user (assumed to be `str` var)
str = degenerate(str, [ 'get' ]);

var fn = vm.runInNewContext('(' + str + ')', {
  get: get
});

console.log(fn);
```


API
---

### degenerator(String jsStr, Array functionNames) â†’ String

Returns a "degeneratorified" JavaScript string, with ES6 Generator
functions transplanted.
